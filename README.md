# YouTube Downloader & More

Contributor: Alex Nguyen 

A simple YouTube Downloader program that uses pytube library to download videos, and optionally extract their relevant information (i.e channel's name, channel's url) from a YouTube object.

The main function of this program is to read YouTube URLs from a csv file, download the associated videos, and write their relevant information into another csv file. 

This program is developed as a solution to help the Social Media team at the Canada Black Music Archives (https://thecbma.com) download YouTube videos more effectively.
